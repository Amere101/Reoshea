                        That's right!!! You can use our services and we don't talk payment until after we agree. You give us what it is your looking for and we give you an estimate of how much we'll charge to get the job done. Yep, it's that SIMPLE.<b> Some thing to note will be that if we have to go out and drive to where the clean out is happening to view the job, then there will still be a charge if we do or don't agree on the clean out.</b> So, if you would like to get an estimate from us just go to the Contact Us tab and send let us know how we can help.
